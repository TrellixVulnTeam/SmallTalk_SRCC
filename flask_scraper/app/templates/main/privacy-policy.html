			<h2 class="header">Disclosures Required By Law</h2>
			<p>
			Here at SmallTalk we protect our users with heavy encryption and do not give out any user information to any third party. However, as with all companies, some situation will require us to forward to a state body or law agency with a user's personal information, in the event of a court order, subpoena, or a state order. We will fight this as much as possible, but if the law requires it, we shall comply.

			Apart from your accounts added connections, SmallTalk naturally collects user data. This consists of: IP address, MAC address, and User agent. These allow us to ensure your account isn't breached, and also collect a general set of data about where our users are located. None of this is passed on to any third party and is used to improve the user experience.
